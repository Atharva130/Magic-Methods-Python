# Magic Methods in Python

## Introduction
Magic methods (also known as dunder methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (`__method__`). They enable the customization of built-in behaviors such as object construction, representation, comparison, and arithmetic operations.

## Key Concepts
- Defined using double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`)  
- Automatically invoked by Python in specific operations  
- Used to define operator overloading, object lifecycle, and more  

## Topics to Learn
- Common magic methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`  
- Operator overloading using methods like `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__eq__`  
- Object comparison with `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__eq__`, etc.  
- Customizing object behavior using `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__call__`
